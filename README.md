# The Big List of Hacked Malware Web Sites

This repository contains a list of all web sites I come across that are hacked with malware. 
Most site owners are unaware their sites have been hacked and are being used to plant malware.

Unfortunately to protect the public I have decided to start posting each and every one I find in this list.

As the list only started today 2017-07-12 it only contains a few entries but it will grow by anywhere from 5-10 a day that I find.

## If you find your site in this list

Your web site has been compromised / hacked and is being used to push out malware to unsuspecting internet users.

## Get your web site fixed or cleaned

Contact me or someone else who can help you clean up and secure your web site

## My web site has been fixed please remove my site !!

Send a PULL REQUEST on the hacked-malware-websites.txt file or <a href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/The-Big-List-of-Hacked-Malware-Web-Sites/issues">log an Issue</a> in the Issues system.

Once I confirm your site is clean and safe it will be removed.
