This repository contains a list of all web sites I come across that are hacked with malware, ransomware or trojans.

### Version Information ##

Some of the sites on the list are purposefully planting malware on their sites and luring people to click links in emails or social links.

Unfortunately to protect the public I have decided to start posting each and every one I find in this list.

As the list only started today 2017-07-12 it only contains a few entries but it will grow by anywhere from 5-10 a day that I find.

## If you find your domain name or web site in <a href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/The-Big-List-of-Hacked-Malware-Web-Sites/blob/master/travisCI/_strip_domains/domains.txt">this list</a>

Your web site has been compromised / hacked and is being used to push out malware to unsuspecting internet users or to redirect users to another web site with malware, pornography or other unsavoury things. Or your web site is listed because you are purposefully hosting malware, viruses, ransomware or trojans.

All listing are shown with the complete url and files being used to push out malware or redirect visitors to your site to a different web site. 

This will help you and your web designer in being able to look for this files, delete them and then look further into your web site for other deceptive files that have been planted by hackers.

# Get your web site fixed or cleaned

The list shows which files have been planted on your site so it makes it easier for you to look for them and clean your site. 

Simply deleting those malware files is not enough you have to find out from an expert how they got into your web site in the first place because if you do not fix that problem they will be back and you also have no idea what else they have planted inside directories or sub-directories on your web site.

# My web site has been fixed please remove my site !!
