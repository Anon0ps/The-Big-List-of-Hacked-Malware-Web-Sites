# The Big List of Hacked Malware Web Sites

This repository contains a list of all web sites I come across that are hacked with malware, ransomware or trojans. 
Most site owners are unaware their sites have been hacked and are being used to plant malware. 

Some of the sites on the list are purposefully planting malware on their sites and luring people to click links in emails or social links.

Unfortunately to protect the public I have decided to start posting each and every one I find in this list.

As the list only started today 2017-07-12 it only contains a few entries but it will grow by anywhere from 5-10 a day that I find.

:exclamation: DO NOT CLICK ON OR VISIT ANY OF THE SITES LISTED HERE :exclamation:

:exclamation: This is merely for information purposes and I will not be held responsible if you decided to click on one of these links and get your computer infected with malware, ransomware a virus or a trojan. :exclamation:

## If you find your site in this list

Your web site has been compromised / hacked and is being used to push out malware to unsuspecting internet users or to redirect users to another web site with malware, pornography or other unsavoury things.

All listing are shown with the complete url and files being used to push out malware or redirect visitors to your site to a different web site. 

This will help you and your web designer in being able to look for this files, delete them and then look further into your web site for other deceptive files that have been planted by hackers.

## Get your web site fixed or cleaned

Contact me or someone else who can help you clean up and secure your web site. 

The list shows which files have been planted on your site so it makes it easier for you to look for them and clean your site. 

Simply deleting those malware files is not enough you have to find out from an expert how they got into your web site in the first place because if you do not fix that problem they will be back and you also have no idea what else they have planted inside directories or sub-directories on your web site.
